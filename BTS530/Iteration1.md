Password, confirm password, optional field for Phone Number, Address and PayPal connection, which can be updated later in settings. The user must accept the Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice agreement. Once the information entered meets the **registration requirements**, the user will be signed in. They will be sent an activation/verification email to confirm their identity/account, which will then allow them to purchase/sell products.
* The **admin** level account must be created through another admin. A username will be their “firstname.lastname”. If there happens to be another person with same name, a number will be added after last name. A temporary password will also be generated for them, which they can change later.
