## Casual Use Case Description

### Registration

* **Main Success Scenario**
  * The user will be prompted for an email address and username, which will be used for identification such as logging in, password resets and support. If a username is already being used, the use will be prompted to enter a different one. Password, confirm password, optional field for Phone Number, Address and PayPal connection, which can be updated later in settings. The user must accept the Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice agreement. Once the information entered meets the **registration requirements**, the user will be signed in. They will be sent an activation/verification email to confirm their identity/account, which will then allow them to purchase/sell products.
  * The **admin** level account must be created through another admin. A username will be their “firstname.lastname”. If there happens to be another person with same name, a number will be added after last name. A temporary password will also be generated for them, which they can change later. Admin account does not require activation. An email will be created for admin and email will use john.doe@companyname.com naming convention.

* **Alternate Flow**
  * The user will be prompted to for an email address, username, password, a confirm password. If the username has been taken, the user will need to enter a different username. If the password does not meet the registration requirements, the user needs to re-enter a password that meets the requirements. Once the information meets the **registration requirements**, the user will be signed in and sent an activation email.
