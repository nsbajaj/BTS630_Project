## System Description
We are developing an E-commerce platform, this platform consists of 3 parts:
 1. **An Admin System** which is a dashboard for our own commerce and account management. It will also be used for approval of marketplace products and adding our internal products.
 2. **A Marketplace System** which is for our customers to list and sell their Product. It will include customization (colour/model, custom order), ability to add Product Name/Description/Instruction/Specifications, choose Shipping options, purchase multiple quantity (In stock/Out of stock/Continued/Discontinued), view the price of a product, place the product in a specific category, Ratings for the buyers, Q/A's for any questions the buyer might have for the seller. It will also contain a "Orders List/Page", which will display which order(s) has been shipped or is being processed before shipping. As well as, which order(s) has been delivered to the customer or have been confirmed to be delivered by the customer. The online payment system that will allow sellers to receieve funds will be through PayPal.
 3. **A Shopping System** which will allow customers to purchase our and the marketplace products. It will be an online listing of products (which has the ability to search, to view and purchase the products). Once a purchase has been made through the shopping cart, buyer(s) can rate product(s), email the seller regarding any defects or any concerns before making a purchase. The online payment system that will allow buyers to purchase products will be through PayPal.

NOTE: The product page will have all the settings to finalize marketplace listing. Verified purchasers will be able to give a product review on the purchased item, so that it helps the other customers to understand it better.
