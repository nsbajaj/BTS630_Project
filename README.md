## System Description
We are developing an E-commerce platform, this platform consists of 3 parts:
 1. **An Admin System** This is a Dashboard system which has 2 modules that mix into 1 complete system.
    * **Admin Component:** The site admin has the ability to create Users, and Grant and remove Users Permissions and status, such as seller, and client, This side also allows for the removal of users from the system or alternatively suspend their Account if infraction to terms are not mayor. As an Admin , they have the ability to create products, and link them to a specific user. Also the Admin has the ability to approve and disapprove items being potentially sold-as part of a review procedures, or revoke ability to be sold for any reason whatsoever, such as DMCA or any other reason provided.
    * **User Component**: This is where the user enters and controls all of their information, address ,name, postal code, countries, etc, in here we control the methods of pay-ment, the user can create products and submit for approval. Here we keep track of orders placed by user, If the user also has a Seller Status/Privileges the inventory and the status of submitted products. As well as any orders to be filled. The User also has the ability to remove products.
 2. **A Marketplace System** which is for our customers to list and sell their Product. It will include customization (colour/model, custom order), ability to add Product Name/Description/Instruction/Specifications, choose Shipping options, update quantity (In stock/Out of stock/Continued/Discontinued), price of a product, place the product in a specific category, and a review system for better understanding of the product. It will also contain a "Orders List/Page", which will display which order(s) has been shipped, or being processed before shipping. As well as, which order(s) have been delivered to the customer. In adition, an online payment system will allow sellers to receieve funds through a PayPal account.
 3. **A Shopping System** which will allow customers to purchase our products, and the marketplace products. It will be an online listing of products (which has the ability to search, to view and purchase the products). Once a purchase has been made, the buyer(s) can rate product(s), and review product(s). The customer can send a message via website to the seller regarding any defects or any concerns about their purchase. The online payment system that will allow buyers to pay for their purchase will be PayPal. 

NOTE: The product page will have all the settings to finalize marketplace listing. Verified purchasers will be able to give a product review on the purchased item, so that it helps the other customers to understand it better.
