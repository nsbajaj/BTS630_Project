## System Description
We are developing an E-commerce platform, this platform consists of 3 parts:
 1. **An Admin System** which is for our own commerce.
 2. **A Marketplace System** which is for our customers to list and sell their Product.
 3. **A Shopping System** (customer side) which is just to buy our and  the marketplace products.
### 1. The Admin System
 * It will be used for approval of marketplace products. 
 * To add our internal products.
### 2. The Marketplace System
 * It will be used for **Product Listing**
   * It will include customization (colour/model, custom order) 
   * Description/Instruction
   * Shipping options
   * Quantity (In stock/Out of stock)
 * **Orders List/Page**, which will show that which orders has been shipped or has to shipped. As well as, which orders has been delivered to the customer.
 * **Mailbox/Messages** to store customers review or message about their received product, or any information that they require before placing an order.
### 3. The Shopping System
 * It will be the online listing of products (which has the ability to search, to buy, and to see the products).
 * The system will also have an online shopping cart.

NOTE: The product page will have all the settings to finalize marketplace listing. Verified purchasers will be able to give a product review on the purchased item, so that it helps the other customers to understand it better.
