## System Description
We are developing an E-commerce platform, this platform consists of 3 parts:
 1. **An Admin System** which is a dashboard for our own commerce and account management. It will also be used for approval of marketplace products and adding our internal products.
 2. **A Marketplace System** which is for our customers to list and sell their Product. It will include customization (colour/model, custom order), ability to add Product Name/Description/Instruction/Specifications, choose Shipping options, update quantity (In stock/Out of stock/Continued/Discontinued), price of a product, place the product in a specific category, and a review system for better understanding of the product. It will also contain a "Orders List/Page", which will display which order(s) has been shipped, or being processed before shipping. As well as, which order(s) have been delivered to the customer. In adition, an online payment system will allow sellers to receieve funds through a PayPal account.
 3. **A Shopping System** which will allow customers to purchase our products, and the marketplace products. It will be an online listing of products (which has the ability to search, to view and purchase the products). Once a purchase has been made, the buyer(s) can rate product(s), and review product(s). The customer can send a message via website to the seller regarding any defects or any concerns about their purchase. The online payment system that will allow buyers to pay for their purchase will be PayPal. 

NOTE: The product page will have all the settings to finalize marketplace listing. Verified purchasers will be able to give a product review on the purchased item, so that it helps the other customers to understand it better.
