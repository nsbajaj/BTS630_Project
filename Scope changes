The program scope has changed and we are now down scaling the scope from marketplace to a mere store program, this changes scopes on the database

this is now a cellphone store

reducing our categories and sub categories a lot.
Phone Manufacturer -> Phone model -> Phone

if we want to add other items it be category and I would believe data would have to be remodelled in this way

Type of Accessory -> Phone model -> Accessory

however this is pending.

This makes also the inventory table much simple

Product has inventory.(this means we can eliminate inventory table

We have now only customers, no admin, removing need of roles other than a biol flag named admin

 this makes admin the main seller
who will have access to orders unfulfilled(yet to be shipped)
 and user
Access to orders placed by them 

Shipping is one flat fee, if at all mentioned, or free shipping to be decided


Paypall  sandbox is still in place.
